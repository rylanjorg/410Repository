this effect is applied on the whole mesh ... there are several ways to limmit it to parts of the mesh:
1- having a texture that defines in white the areas that have full efect and to the black less and less until no effect
2- limmit based on the uv which works if the mesh is unwraped as one piece
3- based on the position of the vertices

I have a video tutorial on some of these methods:
