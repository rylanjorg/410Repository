I have a tutorial video that goes through multyple looks for the marble shader (double reflection):

you can use the reflection probe, an emmision of the texture,a combination or one color for the reflection that the normal map defines it


for the parallax shader, it is a custom node that can be connected to the UV of any texture, this effect depends on a loop so you
 can change that number in the script but increasing it will consume more power and will take more time to compile
